Write a program called LastName_Bioinformatics. py, that will:
a) open the file “genomic_dna.txt”
b) save the contents of the file in a variable called “genome”
c) identify a substring called exon1, from genome, that has an index of 0:63
d) the rest of the “genome” [64: end of genome] is assigned to variable “intron”
e) print the length of “genome”
f) print the length of “exon1” and “intron1”
g) write the contents of “exon1” to another file called “coding.txt”
h) print the contents of “intron1” to the screen
i) close the file genomic_dna.txt 

genome_dna.txt =
"ATCGATCGATCGATCGACTGACTAGTCATAGCTATGCATGTAGCTACTCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCATGCTATCATCGATCGATATCGATGCATCGACTACTAT"

with open("C:/Users/Desktop/genome_dna.txt") as f:
    genome = f.readline()
    
exon1 = genome[0:63]
intron1 = genome[64:]
print(exon1)

print("The length of genome is",len(genome))
print("The length of exon1 is",len(exon1), ", and the length of intron is",len(intron1))

with open("C:/Users/Desktop/coding.txt",'a')as newFile:
    newFile.write(exon1)
print(intron1)
f.close()
